    <h1>Detroit Techno Meets Live Coding</h1>
    <p>
        One of my greatest passions is exploring the potential intersections between computer
        science and music. Thus, after learning about Detroit Techno in a class called "The History and Practice of 
        Electronic Music, I was inspired to create my own rendition, but with a twist. For the drums, I utilized Sonic Pi,
        a programming language designed for live coding.
