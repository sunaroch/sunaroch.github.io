        <p>WHAAAAAA: This is a piece that I made with Ableton Live. In this piece, I prioritized the creation
        of a space, and a binary form with a large buildup.</p>

        <p>Percussive: This is a piece that I created during my time studying abroad at Goldsmiths,
            with samples from instruments made by Hugh Davies. I primarily used Logic Pro X to produce and 
            mix this track. </p>

        <p>Wishwash: This is another piece that I created during my time studying abroad,
        I recorded my own voice, and then heavily effected the recordings using Logic Pro X. </p>

        <p>Detroit Techno Meets Live Coding: After learning about Detroit Techno in a class, I was 
            inspired to create my own rendition, but with a twist. For the drums, I utilized Sonic Pi, a programming 
            language designed for live coding. Using these drums, I built and mixed the rest of the track using Logic Pro X.
