Sun Aroch (ssa2197)
Technical Documentation:

As stated similarly in my blog post, the technical aspects of this installation include:
1. Writing the code for my ESP32 using Sprites in C++
(link to code: https://github.com/sunaroch/sunaroch.github.io/blob/main/portfolio/module1/CircleDoodle/CircleDoodle.ino)
3. Uploading the code to my ESP32 using Arduino
4. Mark soldering the (220 mA) batteries and wires using crimp connectors to ensure both physical and electrical connection.
5. Using heatshrink to protect the wires and conflicting electrical currents (ensuring red wire and black wire do not touch)
6. Connect the battery to the ESP32, and put it in the decorated envelope.
7. Make a hole in the top of the envelope, and drill a hole in a popsicle stick large enough for a string to fit through.
8. Connect the string of desired length to the envelope and the popsicle stick.
9. Hang up the popsicle stick in a ceiling vent alongside other envelopes for full effect
10. Enjoy your installation!
