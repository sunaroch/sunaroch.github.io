    <p>My animation consists of five color-changing spheres floating across a black screen, and text stating “I <3 U x[random number]”. This piece is inspired by Valentine’s Day, and all of the people I hold close to my heart. I decorated my envelope with some hearts, the date, and text saying “This is how much I <3 U”. I wanted the number to be large, between 0 and 10000, and I wanted the spheres to change color between white, red, purple, pink, and magenta, as those colors all remind me of Valentine’s Day. I really enjoyed the process of making my artistic vision become a reality. Please watch this short video!</p>
    
    <p>For the technical aspect of this installation, my peers and I created animations on our individual ESP32s using C++. We then put our ESP32s in envelopes and hung them up side by side.</p>

    <p>In order to prepare for this installation, we used a heatgun and heatshrink to ensure the safety of the wiring. We then drew on our envelopes, and created a hole at the top for our string. Then, we drilled a hole in a popsicle stick, and connected the popsicle stick and the envelope with our ESP32 inside.</p>

    <p>Once we had all of the pieces, we were able to hang up our popsicle sticks in the airvent on Milstein 5. Doesn't it look so nice when they are all hanging together?</p>
